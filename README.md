## Further Improvements
With more than the given time, some improvements that could be made are:
- The use of a state management system such as React Context to avoid further prop drilling.
- Improved testing, including unit tests of each component, e2e testing using a library such as Cypress/Playwright, as well as improving the existing tests by querying accessible roles of elements rather than text. 
- Containerising the app using a tool such as Docker to simplify deployment and ensure consistency across environments.
- Improved Responiveness & Accesibilty
